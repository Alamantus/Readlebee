## Installation

To develop, you'll need to know how to use a terminal or shell on your computer.

Clone the repo to your computer with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) by running:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/Alamantus/book-tracker.git
```

Then run use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

## Usage

After everything's installed, run the "start" NPM script to build and serve the front end:

```
npm run start
```

Then use your browser to navigate to http://localhost:1234 to view the website.

It's early days, so this segment will definitely change later as the project gets more complex.
